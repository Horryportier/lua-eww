; place for your variables
; use this for yor widgets one below is for dev stuff
;(defpoll tmp_var :interval "5s" `make get name=tmp args=""`)
(defpoll tmp_var :interval "5s" `lua eww.lua tmp path:$HOME`)
(defvar debug true)
; thats how you acces your widgets (name=<name_of_widget>)
; when you develop your widget set interval to low number 
; be awere its refreshes your widgets every time its run so input or tmp state might be deleted
; so after development is over set it to high number
